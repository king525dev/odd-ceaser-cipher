{> METHODOLOGIES <}

--> Methodology [1]
- Get shifted in a six-bit array
- Use mask operation to mask each character
- Get shifted again in an ascii array

--> Methodology [2]
- Get shifted in a six-bit array
- Use position to map each value to a new one
- Get shifted again in an ascii array

--> Methodology [3]
- Get shifted in a six-bit array
- Use position to map each value to a new one
- Use mask operation to mask each character
- Get shifted again in an ascii array

--> Methodology [4]
- Get shifted in Ascii array
- Seperate text into 4 character arrays
- Use each index of the key
- Use ceaser cipher on each character based on the position they are in the array 
- Send back the values
